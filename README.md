### Installation
```
cd rbgt_pybind
pip install .
cd ../pyrbgt
pip install .
```

### Usage
A minimal example is provided in `examples/multi_obj_tracking_example.py`. In order to use this tracker, two components are needed:

- a yaml file specifying:
  - path to object model
  - start pose of the object
- an image handle that:
  - stores camera intrinsics
  - return an image if called, and return None if the user wants to stop tracking

An example yaml config can be found at `rbot_two_models_tracking.yaml`; an example image handle object can be found at `rbot_dataset_handle.py`. The example is a replica of the experiments described in the original paper.

### Missing Pieces and WIP
- Renderer is not rendering properly with the viewer window at this point. This also affects extracting of mask information, and keypoints through UV map.
